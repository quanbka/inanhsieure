RE: Calculating pH from pKa? pKa = 10.  The rule is that an equimolar buffer has a pH equal to the pKa and in this problem there is less potassium acetate than acetic acid, so the pH must be lower (more acid) than the pKa within a pH unit or Buffer Effectiveness Relative Amounts of Acid and Base The pH of a buffer depends on the ratio [base]/[acid] rather than on the particular concentration of a specific solution. 17 To get Ka = 10^- 3.
