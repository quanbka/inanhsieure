Reading your answer I suppose you use winters' formula. Master the 5 steps for interpreting acid-base disorders and decode any ABG, VBG, and BMP to find the primary disorder, and any other disorders “tucked away in the ABG”! Compensation is always in the same direction of the primary disorder and brings the pH towards normal.  When this number is within two of the pCO2, the respiratory system is compensating appropriately.  Assess for compensation …SIDReviewed and revised 5/5/12. You need to look at the patient's ABG's - arterial blood gases - to determine what's abnormal, and whether the abnormal values are too high or too low. This is a metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate) and has an appropriate level of respiratory compensation (low paCO2 in the range predicted by Winter’s formula).  SID means Strong Ion Difference (SIDa and SIDe for SID apparent or effective). 21, CO2: 33, HCO3: 12 pH: 7. Oxygen Content Calculation.  The compensation is to increase excretion of H + ion and therefore increase the retention or reabsorption of HCO 3 - into the blood.

Evaluation of a Low Plasma Bicarbonate Using the Urine Anion Gap metabolic acidosis cannot be ruled out because the initial ABG was consistent with both a pure CRA with complete renal compensation and a mixed CRA and metabolic acidosis.  I tend to use Winter's Formula for analyzing metabolic acidosis: it's generally simple-enough math I can easily do in my head.  It means that the compensatory mechanism tried but failed to bring the pH to normal.

PCO2- the PCO2 will be about 6-7 mm HG greater than with an ABG.  The test is used to determine the pH of the blood, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and the bicarbonate level.  This appears elevated and would suggest metabolic compensation is starting to occur but may, in fact, not represent true compensation.  HCO3 from the electrolyte panel and from ABG should be within 2, otherwise uninterpretableThis is called compensation. comwww. If one remembers that there are two main acid-base regulatory mechanisms, then in a case of respiratory acidosis, the kidneys attempt to compensate for the low pH. 2mmHg for every 1 mEq/L HCO 3 The degree of compensation is assessed via the Winter’s FormulaUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center Pittsburgh, PA was recently admitted to the hospital with the following ABG results: pH 7.

All that is needed is a little Step 3: Is there appropriate compensation for the primary disorder? Metabolic acidosis: PCO2 = [1.  The magnitude of respiratory no To check compensation for a metabolic acidosis, easiest is to use the formula: pCO2 = last 2 digits of the pH = [HCO3-] + 15 and if we use this, we would expect to find 30 = 30 = 30 which checks out just fine for metabolic compensation with expected respiratory compensation, exactly.  Your dialysis patients are chronically acidotic because their kidneys are not participating in the compensation system.  ABG interpretation is especially important in critically ill patients.

HCO3-the HCO3 Home Notes 8-Step Guide to ABG Analysis: Tic-Tac-Toe Method. To check compensation for a metabolic acidosis, easiest is to use the formula: pCO2 = last 2 digits of the pH = [HCO3-] + 15 and if we use this, we would expect to find 30 = 30 = 30 which checks out just fineMetabolic compensation: decreased bicarbonate production by kidney (will result in ↓HCO 3 Partial compensation = pH not quite back to normal yet; full compensation = pH normal (you cannot over-compensate)f) Maximal respiratory compensation for a metabolic disorder takes about 12-24 hours and maximal renal compensation for a respiratory disorder takes up to several days.  As a result, pH falls towards normal and HCO3 - concentration falls below normal. 5 &#215;16 + 8 &#177; 2 = 30-34.  Cations = Anions b.  It can be given as = (&#215; − Does anyone understand the ABG compensation thing? I understand the basic concept of metabolic acidosis and alkalosis and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.

Acid-Base Balance and the Anion Gap 1.  Compensation can be seen when both the PCO2 and HCO3 rise or fall together to maintain a normal pH. 26 PCO2 42 The pCO2 is normal designating that no respiratory compensation has occurred.  primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation versus primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation) is dependent on the pH – in an acidotic patient, the acidosis is primary (and the alkalosis is compensatory) and vice versa. 1 change in pH 10 mm change of PaCO 2.  49.  If so, there is compensation by that system. Compensation: In the presence of respiratory alkalosis the kidneys compensate for the increase in pH by retaining H+ ions and excreting HCO3 - ions.  it is helpful to look at them in a stepwise fashion.

Slovis, M.  › Abg compensation formula › Abg compensation calculationMetabolic Acidosis or Respiratory Alkalosis? Evaluation of a Low Plasma Bicarbonate Using the Urine Anion Gap metabolic acidosis cannot be ruled out because the initial ABG was consistent with both a pure CRA with complete renal compensation and a mixed CRA and metabolic acidosis.  If the observed compensation is not the expected compensation, it is likely that more than one acid-base disorder is present. 2 &#215; change in HCO 3 Metabolic alkalosis is common—half of all acid-base hypercapnia in respiratory acidosis before the kidney can excrete the bicarbonate retained for compensation, metabolic alkalosis may occur transiently provided that chloride intake is adequate.
